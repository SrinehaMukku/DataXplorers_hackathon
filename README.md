PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
Ne∆ûlix is an extremely popular internet television platform with streamable content offered in 
several languages and caters to various audiences. In 2006, when Netflix entered this media 
streaming market, they were interested in increasing the efficiency of their existing ''Cinematch'' 
platform by 10% and hence, offered a prize of $1 million to the winning team. This approach 
was successful as they found a solution developed by the BellKor team at the end of the 
competition that increased prediction accuracy by 10.06%. Over 200 work hours and an 
ensemble of 107 algorithms provided this result. These winning algorithms are now a part of the 
Netflix recommendation system. 
Netflix also employs Ranking Algorithms to generate personalized recommendations of movies 
and TV Shows appealing to its users. 
1. Explore and visualize the relationship between the directors and the countries they 
produce content in. Which directors are the most active across multiple countries?
2. Which actor combinations appear most frequently in Netflix titles? Are certain cast 
members more likely to work together? 
3. Visualize the correlation matrix to identify any strong positive or negative 
correlations between the numerical attributes. 
4. Analyze which directors are associated with different types of content (type, i.e., 
"Movie" or "TV Show"). Which directors are more focused on movies, and which 
prefer TV shows? 
5. Investigate the relationship between the release_year of Netflix content and its 
rating (e.g., PG, TV-MA, R). Are certain content ratings more common in specific 
years? 
6. Explore the relationship between duration, rating, and listed_in (genre) by 
visualizing how the duration of content varies across different ratings and genres.
7. Use linear regression to predict the number of genres (listed_in) assigned to a title 
based on its duration. Are longer movies or TV shows associated with more 
genres? 
8. What type of content does Netflix offer to its members w.r.t country 
9. Which country has the highest, average production output of movies and TV 
shows? 
10. Top 5 directors ranked by the number of titles they have produced
